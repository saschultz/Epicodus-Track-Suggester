              <p>As a prospective Epicodus student (or anybody wondering which language to learn), the first thing you need to decide is if you want to focus more on front-end or back-end development. You are interested in being a front-end developer who spends their time making things <strong>look</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>work well</strong>...obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. It sounds like this type of work appeals to you, so your best bet is to take the CSS and Design track at Epicodus.</p>

              <p>Java is a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. Since you're interested in <strong>Android development</strong>, you might find yourself working for an enterprise-level company, or in high-performance applications. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take the Java and Android track at Epicodus.</p>

              <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building <strong>interactive</strong> web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the <strong>Rails</strong> framework, which is written <em>with</em> Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly, which is why we suggest the Ruby and Rails track at Epicodus for you.</p>

              <p>PHP is most used in <strong>content-heavy</strong> websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're <em>keen</em> to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, we suggest you look into the PHP and Drupal track at Epicodus.</p>
